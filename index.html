								<p>All images, including team and founder profiles, will be replaced over time to ensure higher quality and a consistent feel.</p>
								<p>This site uses a center-focused design, moving away from the standard top-bar scroll. This reflects FCH's forward-thinking ideas and future-inspired vision. Why settle for normal when you can be exceptional?</p>
								<p>In the Visionaries section, formal titles like Dr. or Mr./Ms. are omitted after the initial introduction. This choice is intentional to foster relatability, presenting everyone as real, relatable people rather than just selling points.</p>
								<p>As operations kick-off and more media becomes available, media will be continually updated. All sections will be updated with additional information, pictures, links, etc. To boost positive public image and exposure, a Facebook page, YouTube channel, and possibly an Instagram is recommended for brand image.</br>
								After all, public image can make or break a company.(People don’t buy Apple just for the tech; they buy Apple for the image it represents.)</p>
